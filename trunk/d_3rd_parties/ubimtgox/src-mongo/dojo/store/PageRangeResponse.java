 * On your server, you should look at the header in the request to know which

 * indicate how many items are being returned and how many total items exist.
 * For example:
 * 
 * Content-Range: items 0-24/66
 * 
 * The returned total is available as a further promise on the returned promise
 * of data which returns the total number of available rows indicated in the
 * Content-Range: header as a number, so you can retrieve it like this:
